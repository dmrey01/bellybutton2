# belly-button-challenge
Module 14 Challenge
started out by creating a new repository fo rhtsi project called belly button chanllenge.  

Steps -set up the URL 
Ask the system to fetch the Json data and console log 
created the function option change 
created fucntion  update Charts 
created the metadata function to call the data
create the bar chart
then the bubble chart 

had issues at first as the data would not change in the drop demograhic display. 
with a few changes I then lost the complete bubble chart. 

after working on it for a while I made changes to the update charts by renaming it and redoing that section along with option change section.  

eveything seems to working now.
